zaxlog
======

An urbit weblog.

This is an early attempt to figure out what it will take to get a weblog
supported by urbit operational. The log term goal is to move my weblog from
github/jekyll/minimal mistakes permanently onto my urbit planet, ~hosneb-rosler.


*INSTALLATION*

1. Setup a desk to serve my planet's website from:
```
> |merge %zax ~hosneb-rosler %home
```
2. Mount that desk to unix:
```
> |mount /=zax=
```
3. Start serving from the new desk
```
> |serve %zax
```
4. Checkout this project onto the server hosting my planet
```
```
