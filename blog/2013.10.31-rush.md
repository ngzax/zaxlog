Here's [a quote from the legendary Peter Norvig](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html)

> "Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java in 7
> Days alongside endless variations offering to teach Visual Basic,
> Windows, the Internet, and so on in a few days or hours.  I did the
> following power search at Amazon.com :
>
>  pubdate: after 1992 and title: days and (title: learn or title: teach yourself)
>  and got back 248 hits.  
>
>  The first 78 were computer books (number 79 was Learn Bengali in 30 days).  
>
>  I replaced "days" with "hours" and got remarkably similar results: 253
>  more books, with 77 computer books followed by Teach Yourself Grammar
>  and Style in 24 Hours at number 78. Out of the top 200 total, 96% were
>  computer books.
>
>  The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about
>  computers, or that computers are somehow fabulously easier to learn
>  than anything else.  There are no books on how to learn Beethoven, or
>  Quantum Physics, or even Dog Grooming in a few days."
