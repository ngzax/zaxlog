# Announcing [urbit-sync](https://github.com/ngzax/urbit-sync), a small ruby
script to initialize and synchronize your local filesystem and your mounted
urbit pier.

I created this because it was useful for me at this very early stage of urbit's
life. It lets me check out the repos I am working on and not worry about keeping
the files in sync. It also lets me define the packages that I am including in my
base pier setup so when one crashes, getting another one fully  set up is a
single command.

This is the project ~palfun-foslup called "Fancy." ;)

Please see the linked repo above for full instructions. I'd love to hear your
feedback if you find this useful.
